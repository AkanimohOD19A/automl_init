## Introduction
In this project, we will walk through the steps to create a simple ML application, containerize it using Docker, and deploy it to Google Cloud Run. This approach leverages the power of serverless computing to scale your application effortlessly.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- Docker installed on your local machine
- Python installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Python and Docker

## Project Structure
Here's an overview of the project structure:
your-repo-name/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── model/
│   │   └── your_model.pkl
│   ├── static/
│   └── templates/
├── Dockerfile
└── cloudbuild.yaml

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application locally:
```
python app/main.py
```

## Building the Docker Image
Create a Dockerfile to containerize your application:
```
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8080

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app/main.py"]
```

Build the Docker image:
`docker build -t gcr.io/your-project-id/your-image-name .`

## Deploying to Google Cloud Run
1. Push the Docker image to Google Container Registry:
`docker push gcr.io/your-project-id/your-image-name`

2. Deploy to Cloud Run:
`gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/your-project-id/your-image-name --platform managed`

## Usage
Once deployed, you can access your ML application via the URL provided by Google Cloud Run. Use the following endpoint to make predictions:
```
POST /predict
{
  "input_data": [your_input_data]
}
```

Conclusion
Congratulations! You’ve successfully built and deployed your first ML application using Google Cloud Run. For more details, refer to the original blog post.
